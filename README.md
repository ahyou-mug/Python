This repository is where I keep all my useful, ready for the public scripts.
Generally they will be functions that I have found useful but had to write myself for a specific purpose.
They will typically follow the convention of being named after what they do.

Please drop me a comment or a star or something if you find my scripts or find them usefull - it'd be cool to know someone's used it
